HCE PROFILE FORGE
=================

This CLI allows the CRC-32 computation & forging of a HCE profile binary
to prevent HCE from deeming it invalid.

Technical documentation can be found in the source code, however, in a
nutshell:

-   length of blam.sav: 8192 bytes
-   length of the hash: 4 bytes
-   offset of the hash: 0x1FFC // 8192 - 4
-   authenticity check: hash(file) == 0xFFFFFFFF // what hce verifies
-   authenticity forge: write ~hash([0x0000..0x1FFC]) @ offset 0x1FFC

USAGE
-----

Invoke the CLI with any of the following arguments:

    -w, --write                write hash to provided profile binary
    -p, --profile=VALUE        profile to calculate the hash for

EXAMPLES

    ./forge.exe -p ~/blam.sav -w # calculate hash and patch it to the
                                   provided profile binary

                                   ommitting -w will invoke the CLI in
                                   read-only mode and not modify the
                                   provided binary
